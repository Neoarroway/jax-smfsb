# JAX-SMfSB

## SMfSB code in Python+JAX

Code relating to the book *Stochastic Modelling for Systems Biology, third edition*.
There is a regular Python+Numpy package on PyPI, [smfsb](https://pypi.org/project/smfsb/), which has complete coverage of the book.
*This package is currently a WIP*, but will only ever cover the *core simulation and inference algorithms from the book*. However, these core algorithms will run very fast, using [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/). You must install JAX (which is system dependent), before attempting to install this package.

Once you have JAX installed and working correctly, you can install this package with:
```bash
pip install jsmfsb
```



Import:
```python
import jsfmsb
```
